\title{electre3 : ELECTRE III method for ranking alternatives}
\description{
ELECTRE III  method aims to answer the following question: considering a
 finite set of actions, A, evaluated on a coherent family of
 pseudo-criteria, F, how to make a partition of A in classes of  quivalence
 and provide a necessarily complete pre-order expressing the relative
 position of these classes? In the first phase, ELECTRE III method involves
 the construction of a fuzzy outranking relation.

In the second phase, an algorithm is used for making a ranking in a final
 partial pre-order, that combines two complete pre-orders.

This implementation presents simplified version of the method using single
 value alpha, beta parameters. If more complex approach to ELECTRE III
 computation is required use OutrankingTools package for R, which provides
 variant allowing such computations.

The procedure itself is as follows. First we compute Concordance matrix.
 Concordancce matrix (index) measures strength of the statement that
 alternative a outranks alternative b.

To compute concordance matrix, partial concordance matrix \mjseqn{c_j} of
 the criteria needs to be computed first. The partial concordance matrix
 considers concordance by comparing performances of the alternatives in
 criterium \mjseqn{j}.

\mjsdeqn{c_j(a,b) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll} 1 & \;if\; PM_j(a) + Q_j(a) \ge PM_j(b) \cr 0 & \;if\; PM_j(a) + P_j(a) < PM_j(b)) \cr \frac{PM_j(a) - PM_j(b) + P_j(a)}{P_j(a) - Q_j(a)} & else\end{array}\right.}

Based on partial concordance matrixes we compute concordence matrix
 \mjseqn{C} as:

\mjsdeqn{C(a,b) = \frac{\sum (w_j \cdot c_j(a,b))}{\sum w_j}}

Then we compute discordance matrixes \mjseqn{d_j} separately for each
 criterion using:

\mjsdeqn{d_j(a,b) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll} 1 & \;if\; PM_j(b) > PM_j(a) + V_j(a) \cr 0 & \;if\; PMj(b) \le PM_j(a) + P_j(a) \cr \frac{PM_j(b) - PM_j(a) - P_j(a)}{V_j(a) - P_j(a)} & else\end{array}\right.}

where

PM ... performance of alternative in criterion, Q ... indifference
 threshold, P ... prefference threshold, V ... veto threshold, w ...
 weights.

Based on discrodance matrixes \mjseqn{d_j} we compute credibility matrix
 \mjseqn{S}

\mjsdeqn{S(a,b) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll} C(a,b) & \;if\; d_j(a,b) \le C(a,b) \cr C(a,b) \cdot \prod_{\forall j \in J} \frac{1 - d_j(a,b)}{1 - C(a,b)} & \;otherwise\; \end{array}\right.}

where J is set of criteria \mjseqn{j} for which \mjseqn{d_j(a,b) > C(a,b)}

Finaly we may use the information to derive ranking of the alternatives.To
 do that we will perform descending rank distilation
 \code{\link{Electre_desc_dist}}, followed by ascending rank distilation
 \code{\link{Electre_asc_dist}}, then we agregate both into final rank
 \code{\link{finalRanking}}.

Preorder for descending rank distilation is achieved by distilling
 alternatives from credibility matrix using progresively lower cutoff
 thresholds \mjseqn{\lambda}. first value of the \mjseqn{\lambda} is
 computed:

\mjsdeqn{\lambda_1 = max_{a,b \in A}S(a,b)}

where A ... is set of alternatives.

Ascending distilation works similarly, but going up from lowest values in
 credibility matrix using progressively higher cutoff thresholds
 \mjseqn{\lambda}.

Since both preorders can be different gathered information needs to be
 further processed by creation of pre-order matrix. This matrix provides
 comparison between all alternatives by comparing their mutual rankings in
 descending and ascending preorders.

Suppose we compare alternatives a and b. We already have available its ranks
 in descending (\mjseqn{D_a, D_b}) and ascending (\mjseqn{A_a, A_b})
 preorders. We will use this information to derive relation between the two
 alternatives.

If (\mjseqn{D_a < D_b} and at same time \mjseqn{A_a < A_b}) or
 (\mjseqn{D_a == D_b} and at same time \mjseqn{A_a < A_b})  or
  (\mjseqn{D_a < B_b} and at same time \mjseqn{A_a == A_b}) we can say that
 that a is prefered to b (aPb). In other words aPb if it is either preffered
 in both preorders or when it is better ranked in one while being evaluated
 as equal in other.

Since we work with matrix we use [a, b] = P+ and [b, a] = P- notation to
 express it.

Same rules apply for bPa, leading to [a, b] = P- and [b, a] = P+.

We can also say that if the ranks of the alternatives in both preorders are
 same, then we are indifferent to them preferantion wise: aIb, leading to
 [a, b] = [b, a] = I.

Otherwise the alternatives are incomparable: aRb, leading to
 [a, b] = [b, a] = R. That can hapen if in one preorder aPb, while in second
 one bPa.

This information is directly usable for final ranking derivation.

Please note, that ELECTRE IV (see \code{\link{Electre_4}}) uses same
 procedure for rank derivation, but does not use weights.

\subsection{Method \code{sensitivity()}}{
sensitivity analysis for ELECTRE III (see \code{\link{lectre3}} object
 documentation) is performed on values of preference (p), indefference
 (q) and veto (v) thresholds.

Since the thresholds (all of them) are specfied separately for each
 criterion, their sensitivity needs to be also evaluated seprately.
 This is being realized in this function by generating separate
 dataframe for each threshold (sens_p, sens_q, sens_v) with following
 structure:

criterium; from; default; to

From and to limits are limist of of solution stability, meaning that
 going under it (from) or over it (to) will produce different result.

Sensitivity is tested from default value (the value used to produce
 result) going down to 0 for from column and up to maximal performance
 in the criterium j (max(pm[j])). If no change in result is detected,
 value "insens." is inserted into dataframe.
